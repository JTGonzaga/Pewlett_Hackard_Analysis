# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Overview
  After creating a database of all employee information in Pewlett Hackard, I was assigned to analyze the database and display the employees who are currently employed and eligible for retirement. This information was to be sorted by job title to get a better understanding of the types of jobs that could be needing replacements soon. The database was also utilized to create a comprehensive list of employees who are eligible for mentorship in the company's mentorship program to help new hires. 
## Results
  Below is the database that was used to gather the information needed:

  - Through this visualization of the database we are able to see how multiple files of information are all connected. Using this sysyem allows information to be compiled to fit the criteria of any charts that need to be created. Originally, we created a list of all current employees that are eligible for retirement.

 - This list can be used by upper management as a list of employees to inquire about retirement to get a more exact understanding of who will be retiring and whose job will need to be filled. To get a more general idea of the jobs that need to be potentially replaced, this information was broken down to a number of all those eligible for retirement based on job title.

 - Through this new dataset, we can see that the largest groups that are going to be affected by those retiring are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. Just these two categories account for around 50,000 jobs within in the company. It's safe to assume that these positions are going to be the most important to look for since they account for such a large portion of the workforce.
 - Mentorship is something that is important to incorporate in any thriving business. The processes have been learned and well understood by those who have been within the company for the longest should be passed down to new hires in order to maintain a standard of work and allow for a more personal connection to those in higher positions. Below is a list of current employees that could potentially qualify for the mentorship program

 ## Summary
  With the upcoming "silver tsunami", it's easy to recognize that a large portion of the company is eligible for retirement. Although all those eligible may not retire, it is important to act on and prepare for new hires to fill the roles of those retiring. In total, there are 72,458 employees that could retire across all job titles. We must assume that all these roles need to be filled in order to ensure the company is fully constructed. A large portion of these jobs that need to be filled come from senior positions. This begs the question of if the company is prepared to promote within the company to fill these roles. To get a better understanding of those that are eligible for retirement, but not yet incorporated in the Senior roles for mentorship, I have provided a count for potential replacements within the company.

 As we can see there are 1,549 current employees that are eligible to become mentors for Pewlett Hackard's new hires.
